## H2 Public Wifi

#### H4 Being a college student I spend a lot of my time out of class at coffee shops on public free wifi. This is a good thing because you can set it up fast and even with a lot of people on it they tend to be really quick, and of course they are free which everyone loves. Free wifi is also very easy to hack, as you will see in the video below, so make sure you do not share personal data.

## H2 Big companies have been hacked

#### H4 hacking is not just in small coffee shops. Large multi-billion dollar companies suffer from hackers too. Some recent examples of this could be in 2014 when Sony was hacked and data from the film studio was exposed, or the year before that when Target was and milions of peoples credit cards information was leaked. 
#### H4 more than 50% of cyberhacks are because of user error. I believe one way to fix this problem is to have employees do trainning sessions.
